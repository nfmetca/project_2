        <p class="careerp1">Otl Aicher had a remarkable career as a designer and is widely celebrated for his
            contributions to modern graphic design and visual communication. He is best known for co-founding the Ulm
            School of Design &lpar;Hochschule für Gestaltung&rpar; in 1953, which became one of Germany’s most
            influential design institutions, known for its functional and systematic approach to design. The Ulm School
            remained a leading educational center until its closure in 1968, shaping a generation of designers with its
            emphasis on social responsibility and clarity.</p>

        <p class="careerp2">Aicher's influence extended into corporate branding, where he created iconic designs that
            are still recognized today. One of his most famous works is the branding for Lufthansa, where he designed
            the airline’s distinctive logo and visual identity. Aicher also designed logos for the University of
            Konstanz and the Munich Airport among others. His streamlined, modern approach set new standards in
            corporate branding.</p>
        <p class="careerp3">In 1972, Aicher was appointed as the lead designer for the Munich Olympics, where he
            developed a revolutionary system of pictograms to represent various sports. This visual language was
            designed to be universally understood, establishing a new standard for wayfinding and event branding that is
            still used in Olympic design today. His approach helped shape the concept of visual identity systems in
            public spaces, influencing countless future designers.</p>

        <p class="careerp4">Aicher was also an accomplished writer and thinker, and in one of his books “The World as
            Design”, he explored his philosophy on design’s role in shaping society. Later in his career, in 1980, he
            became a design consultant for the German kitchen manufacturer Bulthaup, bringing his modernist perspective
            to the kitchen industry. In 1988, he created the Rotis typeface, a unique and widely used font that reflects
            his clean and functional design style. Rotis is still used today by Bulthaup.</p>
        <p class="careerp5">Aicher’s work continues to impact the design world. His innovations in wayfinding and his
            commitment to clear, socially engaged design remain influential, and his visual language is still used in
            public spaces across the globe. Throughout his life, Aicher received numerous accolades and had his work
            exhibited internationally, securing his legacy as a pioneer in modern design.</p>
