        </div>
        <p class="olympicsp">Aicher’s work on the 1972 Munich Olympics is perhaps his most famous project and a landmark
            in modern graphic design. Tasked with creating a comprehensive visual identity for the Games, he developed a
            unified system of pictograms to represent each sport, using clean, geometric shapes. These symbols were
            designed to be universally understood, regardless of language, which was particularly important for an event
            attended by people from around the world. The pictograms were highly effective, establishing a visual
            language that set the standard for future Olympic Games. Aicher also created a vibrant, optimistic color
            palette, using light blues, greens, and silvers to give the event a friendly and welcoming look, in stark
            contrast to Germany's past Olympic branding. This project not only made navigation easier for attendees but
            also reinforced Aicher's belief in functional, inclusive design.</p>
        <h3 class="luft">LUFTHANSA CORPORATE IDENTITY</h3>
        <div class="luft1">
        <img src="imgs/luft_1.jpg" alt="Reads 'L Lufthansa' over a grid with logo of a crane in a circle">
    </div><div class="luft2">
        <img src="imgs/luft_2.jpg" alt="logo of a crane in a circle">
    </div>
        <p class="luftp">In the early 1960s, Aicher was commissioned to redesign the corporate identity of Lufthansa,
            Germany’s national airline. His approach was groundbreaking for corporate branding, as he developed a
            cohesive visual system that included a streamlined, geometric logo along with a distinct yellow and blue
            color scheme. Aicher’s design prioritized clarity and consistency, ensuring that every element, from the
            logo to the signage and printed materials, reflected Lufthansa’s identity in a unified way. The minimalist
            logo—a simplified crane within a circle—has endured as one of the most recognizable logos in aviation
            history and remains a core part of Lufthansa's branding today. Aicher's work with Lufthansa set new
            standards for corporate identity systems and demonstrated how a cohesive visual approach could enhance a
            company’s public image and brand recognition.</p>
        <h3 class="ulm">ULM VOLKSHOCHSCHULE POSTERS</h3>
        <div  class="ulm1">
        <img src="imgs/ulm_1.jpg" alt="Abstract poster with curved shapes and text.">
        </div>
        <div class="ulm2">

        </div>
        <p class="ulmp">During the 1950s, Aicher designed a series of posters for the Ulm Volkshochschule, or Ulm Adult
            Education Center, where he promoted courses in the arts and humanities. These posters exemplified his
            modernist and minimalist approach, using bold typography, simple geometric forms, and limited color palettes
            to create striking visuals that captured attention while conveying clear information. Aicher’s designs were
            both visually appealing and functional, and they demonstrated his belief in the importance of public
            education. His work for the Volkshochschule also contributed to the growing reputation of Ulm as a center of
            modern design and influenced public poster design in Germany. These posters are still celebrated as classic
            examples of mid-20th-century graphic design.</p>
        <h3 class="rotis">ROTIS TYPEFACE</h3>
        <div  class="rotis1">
        <img src="imgs/rotis_1.jpg" alt="full character list of rotis semi serif">
        </div>
        <div class="rotis2">
        <img src="imgs/rotis_2.jpg" alt="full character list of rotis sans serif">
        </div>
        <p class="rotisp">In 1988, Aicher designed the Rotis typeface, named after the village of Rotis in Bavaria,
            where he lived and worked. Rotis was unique in that it combined elements of serif and sans-serif typefaces,
            making it both versatile and visually distinctive. Aicher’s goal was to create a typeface that could be used
            in a variety of contexts, from body text to headings, while maintaining readability and clarity. The result
            was a typeface family that included different versions—Rotis Sans, Rotis SemiSans, Rotis SemiSerif, and
            Rotis Serif. Although the typeface received mixed reviews, with some critics considering it too stylized,
            Rotis gained popularity and has been used widely in corporate design and publishing. Rotis reflects Aicher’s
            dedication to functional, clear, and aesthetically appealing typography.</p>
        <h3 class="isny">ISNY POSTERS</h3>
        <div class="isny1">
        <img src="imgs/isny_1.jpg" alt="Minimalist rain scene with two umbrella silhouettes.">
        </div>
        <div class="isny2">

        <img src="imgs/isny_3.jpg"
            alt="Stylized forest scene with vertical tree trunks and a silhouetted fox.">
        </div>
            <p class="isnyp">Later in his career, Aicher designed a series of posters for the town of Isny im Allgäu in southern Germany. These posters are notable for their minimalist, black-and-white graphic style, using only the most essential shapes to depict various aspects of the town and its surroundings. The posters feature simple silhouettes of animals, people, and local landmarks, capturing the charm and character of Isny in a visually engaging way. Aicher’s Isny posters are a powerful example of his belief in “less is more” and his commitment to creating designs that are both functional and visually compelling. By using minimalistic graphics, Aicher created a timeless visual identity for the town, one that continues to be associated with Isny’s cultural image.</p>
