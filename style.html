            <p class="stylep2">Aicher often employed bold colors, but he was deliberate in his choices, preferring a limited color palette to maintain a cohesive and harmonious look. This use of color was not merely decorative; it was functional, helping to guide viewers’ attention and convey information effectively. His commitment to simplicity allowed his designs to communicate complex ideas with ease, making them accessible to a wide audience. His minimalistic yet striking style has influenced countless designers and continues to be seen as a benchmark for clarity and modernism in visual communication.</p>
